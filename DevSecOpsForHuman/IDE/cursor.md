# Tips



- Always create a new project in an empty folder
- When express demand, be explicit, but not too much explicit
- Let it write readme at first, be a long term memory
- Write NL outline while programming
- Using git to manage versions. When at some success **checkpoint**, add commit. 
- Ctrl + I start composer to write something, using '**save all**' firstly, rather than 'accept all'. because if cursor failed, we can reject all
- Using @codebase.
- @<frequent QA doc links>
- Rules for AI, like system prompt. Set my perference for programming and language
- Delete account then register, avoid paying for premium.
