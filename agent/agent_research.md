In the academic communit, research of agent can be divided into:

- RL-based Agent
  - Instruction following
  - Language as knowledge
  - World model
  - LLM as tool
  - Generalization ability
  - Continual learning
  - RL + LLM
  - Trajectory to language
  - Trajectory predication
  - Others
- LLM-based Agent
  - multimodal
  - General Reasoning & planning & Tool using
  - 
  - Task-specific
  - Multi-Agent cooperation
  - Experimental analysis
  - Benchmark & Dataset
  - Application
  - Algorithm design
  - Others
-
