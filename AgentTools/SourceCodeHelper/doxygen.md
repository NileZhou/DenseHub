[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html)

Doxygen is a widely-used documentation generator tool in software development. It automates the generation of documentation from source code comments, parsing information about classes, functions, and variables to produce output in formats like HTML and PDF.


Doxygen can generate graphical representations of class hierarchies and collaboration diagrams, providing a visual overview of the relationships between classes and functions.


Configuration:
Doxygen provides a configuration file (Doxyfile) that allows users to customize the documentation generation process. You can control various settings, such as the output format, file inclusion/exclusion, and more.
