Developing AI agents capable of self-evolution and achieving Turing completeness is a major frontier in artificial intelligence research. Early efforts, such as Program-aided Language Models (PAL)【PAL】 and CodeAct【CodeAct】, laid the groundwork by using large language models (LLMs) to automate code generation and execution, enabling AI agents to interact with their environments by writing and executing code. These methods, however, are largely limited to single-turn interactions, which restricts the agents' ability to maintain and adapt complex runtime contexts over multi-turn engagements. Recently, Chain of Thought (CoT)【CoT】 reasoning has gained attention for enhancing LLMs’ expressiveness in inherently serial tasks. CoT has been theoretically proven to achieve Turing completeness in reasoning, enabling models to handle complex problems that require sequential processing【CoT Empowers】. However, despite its ability to improve abstract reasoning, CoT remains confined to thought pathways and lacks direct code execution. Similarly, Diagram of Thought (DoT)【DoT】 focuses on refining logical reasoning using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), but neither CoT nor DoT involves the kind of real-time, executable interaction with environments required for dynamic, multi-step problem-solving. In contrast, MOSS integrates code execution with dynamic context management, allowing agents not only to reason but also to act in real-world environments, debug, and refine solutions iteratively.
