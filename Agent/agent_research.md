In the academic communit, research of agent can be divided into:

- RL-based Agent
  - Instruction following
  - Language as knowledge
  - World model
  - LLM as tool
  - Generalization ability
  - Continual learning
  - RL + LLM
  - Trajectory to language
  - Trajectory predication
  - Others
- LLM-based Agent
  - multimodal
  - General Reasoning & planning & Tool using
  - 
  - Task-specific
  - Multi-Agent cooperation
  - Experimental analysis
  - Benchmark & Dataset
  - Application
  - Algorithm design
  - Others
-

# Key features of a embodied-agent

- **Plan**: Long horizon tasks, like "can you make me a coffee"
- **Reinforcement learning**: Policy correction via human feedback
- **Imitation Learning**: updating the action library
- **Continual Learning**: adapting to a changing environment
- **Remote supervisory control**:

Updating the action library with imitation learning
